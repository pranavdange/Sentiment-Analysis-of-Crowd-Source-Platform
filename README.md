# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Crowd-Source-Platform

Crowdsourcing involves seeking knowledge, goods, or services from a large body of people. These people submit their ideas in response to online requests made either through social media, smartphone apps, or dedicated crowdsourcing platforms like – Yelp.
Now with this huge data - Yelp have mountains of customer feedback collected. Yet for mere humans, it’s still impossible to analyze it manually without any sort of error or bias.
Now, with an intention to classify whether the sentiment is good, bad or average the intended solution will aim at automizing the process and make it less manual as possible.

Approach 

Data Analysis
Data Preprocessing 
Finding the Correlation between features
Discovering the pattern
 Separate the dataset into X and Y for prediction
Cleaning the reviews - removal of stop words and punctuation
Converting the words into a vector
Using multiple Machine Algorithms to see which gives the best performance.
Gearing up for Deployment

Final Words

With an aim in mind to successfully created a platform – which can automatically predict from reviews (completely in text format ) whether the input – reviews in this case is good, bad or an average sentiment which in turn providing an opportunity for the user to take proactive actions and address the concern there and there itself.
